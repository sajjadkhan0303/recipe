<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparition</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
    Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil .</li>
    <li>
        Pop a tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enjoy!
